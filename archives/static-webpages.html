<p>The main limitation of static webpages is that you can&#39;t give different webpages to different people. But for many situations, such as a blog, this is perfectly okay. And the advantages are numerous:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fast page loads - you can&#39;t beat serving static files.</li>
<li>Low server requirements - pretty much any system will do.</li>
<li>No database - and therefore no security worries.</li>
<li>No CMS - low learning curve and no heart-stopping moments of &quot;The site is down!&quot; (unless your server crashes).</li>
<li>Easy to work with - just knowing html and css can make a beautiful site. With Jekyll, writing posts only involves knowing markdown, so anyone can do it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reading about advantages/disadvantages of static websites online will have you believe that all of them are unholy messes of unmaintainable orphaned .html files. But a good system like Jekyll can take care of everything that a CMS might.</p>
