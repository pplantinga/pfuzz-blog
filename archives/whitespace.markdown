All my readers deserve to know where I stand on the whitespace issues that are so hotly contested. I know you've heard all the arguments more times than you care to count, so I'll keep it brief.

First I'll let you know that I like pretty much every whitespace-sensitive language that exists, including the ones that went into this website, like haml and sass, and a few that didn't, including python and haskell. Why do I like them so much? They're pretty. They're clean. They require less typing. And I've never had a problem with whitespace errors.

Also, I'm a tab-indent guy. I like the fact that it is more semantically meaningful and that each person can choose how wide their indent is without having to replace them all.
