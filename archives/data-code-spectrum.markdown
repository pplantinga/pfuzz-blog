In a simple model of computing, data and code are two separate things. The data is acted on by the code and produces more data. But if you look a bit deeper, you can see that this is not actually the case. I think of them more as a spectrum with seismographs on one end and ∫x²∂x on the other. I've created a pictorial representation:
