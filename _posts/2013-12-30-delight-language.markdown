I'm about to embark on a journey.

Writing a programming language.

Fortunately my task is not as daunting as it sounds. I'm simply going to write a preprocessor for the [D programming language](/archives/d-programming-language.html) that gives it a python-like syntax. If you haven't heard, this will probably be pretty close to my ideal language, since I love [D's features and Python's syntax](/archives/compiled-vs-interpreted.html). 

My project is happening at [github.com/pplantinga/delight](http://github.com/pplantinga/delight) so feel free to take a gander (once I've had a chance to work on it) and contribute if it's something you're interested in!
