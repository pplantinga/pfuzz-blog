Loops in Delight will look a lot like Python loops. I'll also mention arrays, since for loops in Delight will primarily iterate over arrays. The only real difference from D is that in multidimentional array declarations and references, commas are used.

{% highlight python %}
int[, 3] ints = [[2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]]
ints[2, 1] = ints[2, 0] + 10

for i in 0 .. 10:
	x += i

auto array = ["foo":"bar", "blah":"blah"]
for key, item in array:
	if key equal to "blah" and item equal to "blah":
		writeln( "found 'blah'" )

while x less than y:
	x *= 10
{% endhighlight %}

Nothing too surprising here.

**Edit** Now there are more loop-able features!

{% highlight python %}
	print 0 .. 10 by 2
	# prints [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

	# Works for decrementing too
	auto vals = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
	for i in vals.length - 1 .. 0 by -1
		vals[i] = vals[i - 1]

	# Also, list comprehensions!
	for i in { 2 * x for x in 0 .. 10 by 2 where x ^ 2 more than 3 }:
		print i

	# 4
	# 8
	# 12
	# 16
{% endhighlight %}
