Loops in delight will look a lot like python loops. I'll also mention arrays, since for loops in delight will primarily iterate over arrays. The only real difference from D is that in multidimentional array declarations and references, commas are used.

{% highlight python %}
string[string] array = ["foo":"bar", "blah":"blah"]
int[, 3] ints = [[2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]]
ints[2, 1] = ints[2, 0] + 10

for i in 0 .. 10:
	x += i

for key, item in array:
	if key equal to "blah" and item equal to "blah":
		writeln( "found 'blah'" )

while x less than y:
	x *= 10
{% endhighlight %}

Nothing too surprising here.
