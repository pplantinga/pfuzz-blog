I just tagged my first release in Delight! And in Github for that matter.

Version 0.1-alpha is still pre-release, but it's a step in the right direction. It includes support for classes and templates.

{% highlight D %}
class woodchucks:
	int teeth = 2

	method bite( int tree ):
		return tree - teeth

class woodchucks(T):
	T teeth

	method bite( T tree ):
		return tree - teeth

procedure main:
	woodchucks w = new woodchuck()
	woodchucks!int wi = new woodchuck!int()
{% endhighlight %}
