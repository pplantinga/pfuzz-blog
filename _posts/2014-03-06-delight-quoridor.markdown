Quoridor is my favorite board game. I have also programmed it in way too many languages, including:

* Java
* Javascript
* Objective-C
* D
* and now... Delight!

This project has helped me kill a massive number of bugs in the D compiler. So when I'm done, I may release a for-real version of the Delight compiler!
