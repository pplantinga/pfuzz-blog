I'm delighted to inform you that [Delight preprocessor](http://github.com/pplantinga/delight) can now convert a "Hello, world!" program into D code!

{% highlight python %}
procedure main:
	print "Hello, world!"
{% endhighlight %}

I'm still debating many of the finer points of the language, so expect another post soon asking for your opinions.
