I'm delighted to inform you that [delight preprocessor](http://github.com/pplantinga/delight) can now convert a "Hello, world!" program into D code!

{% highlight D %}
import std.stdio

void main():
	writeln( "Hello, world!" )
{% endhighlight %}

I'm still debating many of the finer points of the language, so expect another post soon asking for your opinions.
