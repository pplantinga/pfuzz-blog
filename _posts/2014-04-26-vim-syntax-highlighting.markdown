Just a quick post to highlight (pun intended) some good work in the arena of vim syntax highlighting.

Terminal vim by default looks terrible, but due to [CSApprox by Matt Wozniski](http://github.com/vim-scripts/CSApprox) and [CSExact by Kevin Goodsell](http://github.com/KevinGoodsell/vim-csexact) this can be easily remedied.

After installing these plugins, I've started trying many different code highlighters. Previously I used [wombat](https://dengmao.wordpress.com/2007/01/22/vim-color-scheme-wombat/) which I still think is a great theme. Here are some others that I tried and liked:

* [Herald](https://h3rald.com/articles/herald-vim-color-scheme/)
* [Twilight (clone of TextMate)](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1677)
* [Vanzan color](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2504)

And the winner is ... [Jellybeans](https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim)!

You can see samples of all these themes at [vim color test](http://vimcolorschemetest.googlecode.com/svn/html/index-c.html).

What's your favorite theme? Let me know in comments.
