Besides trying out Jekyll, github pages, compass, static webpages, etc. I thought it might be nice to have a place for my computer science-related thoughts. Here you can find my projects, ideas, ramblings, insights, failures, and more.

This blog is named "P-Fuzz" after my super-cute purple fuzzy hand-warmer (that happens to look a lot like the logo). Of course, it also stands for all of the Peter-brain fuzz that makes it into the posts on this blog. Hopefully the process makes my thoughts clearer than fuzz.

Resources on the things I mentioned:

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* [Github pages](http://pages.github.com)
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org)
* [Static webpages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page)
