Besides trying out Jekyll, github pages, haml, compass, statically-served webpages, etc... I thought it might be nice to have a place for my computer science-related thoughts. Here you can find my projects, ideas, ramblings, insights, failures, and more.

Resources on the things I mentioned:

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* [Github pages](http://pages.github.com)
* [Haml](http://haml.info)
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org)
* [Statically-served webpages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page)
