My most recent project is reviving my intro CS project, a clone of the board game [Quoridor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoridor). I had to decompile the code from an old JAR file, clean it up a bit, and then upload it to a [github repository](http://github.com/pplantinga/passaj).

I've rewritten a lot of the code, but it was still a good starting point. Hopefully soon I'll have a version you can download and try!

In addition to normal Quoridor, there's also Hexagonal Quoridor, which is a variant I've created on a hexagonal board. Get excited! :)
